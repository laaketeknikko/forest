TODO: Implement a global notification / log display.

TODO: Making a save game needs to be rethought.
At the moment the character, enemy and scenario data in the save game

that are not in the scenario but are in the selection.

TODO: Update save data when scenario is started.

TODO: Implement some frontend tests.

TODO: Combat log?

TODO: performance optimizations.

TODO: prevent characters from leaving the arena.

TODO: Make enemy starting positions an array to support multiples of same type

TODO: Make the cards prettier.

TODO: Apparently it might not be a good idea to unmount and remount
the Fiber canvas. Should change to just mount once somehow.

TODO: Generate a new save on newgame

TODO: Autosave?

TODO: Allow defining own keystring.

TODO: empty party on entering main menu after scenario won.
Probably required separating active party from all available charactesr
in save game.

TODO: Fix loading game with invalid key.

TODO: In confirmation screen, if only one character is chosen, the
character is too small.
