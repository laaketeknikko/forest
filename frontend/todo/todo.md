TODO: Implement some frontend tests.

TODO: Combat log?

TODO: prevent characters from leaving the arena.

TODO: Make enemy starting positions an array to support multiples of same type

TODO: Make the cards prettier.

TODO: Apparently it might not be a good idea to unmount and remount
the Fiber canvas. Should change to just mount once somehow.
